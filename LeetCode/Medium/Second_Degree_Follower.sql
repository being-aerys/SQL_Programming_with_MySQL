In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.

For example:

+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explaination:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.




Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in followers alphabet order.

SELECT F.followee AS follower, COUNT(DISTINCT F.follower) AS num
FROM follow F
WHERE F. followee IN (SELECT DISTINCT F2.follower
                     FROM follow F2)
GROUP BY F.followee
ORDER BY F.followee;
